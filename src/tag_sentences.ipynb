    "However, note that \"Ted Curson\" is tagged as musician in one instance, and Cecil Taylor in another. SPIKE's output only shows one match per line. If a sentence has several matches, the sentence will be found several times in the csv, each time pointing to a different match. Also note, that while we can suspect (by common sense or knowledge) that Cyrille is also a musician, the above patterns do not capture that, so `Cyrille` is tagged as `[O]`.\n"
